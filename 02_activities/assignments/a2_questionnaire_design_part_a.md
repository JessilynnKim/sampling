# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to determine key contributing factors to high turnover rate, specifically among entry- and lower-level employees. It is also to identify the changes that can be done to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population: entry and lower-level employees within all departments at the company (current and recently departed)
Sampling frame: List of all entry- and lower-level employees and their employement status, department and contact information (current and recently departed)
Sampling units: Individuals who are in entry- or lower-level positions (current and recently departed)
Observational units: Employees' responses to the survey 
Sampling Strategy: stratified random sampling - divided into strata based on department and employment status at which random sample will be determined. This is to ensure all departments and employment statuses are represented 
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
If you have recently departed from the company, please refer to your last role at this company as your "current" role. 
1. How satisfied are you with your current role? 
2. Please describe main challenges or frustrations you have encountered in your role. 
3. Do you feel your current salary and benefits package in comparison to industry standards?
4. Do you believe there are enough opportunities for career advancement in your role?
5. How supportive have your manager/supervisor in your development?
6. How likely are you to consider leaving your current job within next 6 months? 
7. What changes would you suggest to make your job more satisfying or to improve your work environment?
8. Any additional comment would you like to share? 

```
